\begin{frame}{Background}{Modelling Day-Ahead Prices}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> Every day, hourly prices for the following day are set based on trading activity
  \item<3-> Prices are determined from the same information set \(\implies\) panel data
  \item<4-> Common to consider base prices, i.e.\ daily means
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Our Goals}{}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> Model the day-ahead prices of each hour individually, as daily time series
  \item<3-> Capture their joint behaviour with a copula-based model
  \item<4-> Simulate the day-ahead price distribution from the full model
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
