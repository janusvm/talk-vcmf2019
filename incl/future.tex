  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> Compare results with univariate model for average prices
  \item<3-> Majority of pair-copulas in first tree are \(t\)-copulas---model could be compared to a 24-dimensional \(t\)-copula
  \item<4-> Simulation occasionally yields infinite values; about 2.5\% of samples contained infinite values, and out of those, these values comprised about 0.5\% of the sample---could be kinks in the code or parts of the model itself
  \end{itemize}
